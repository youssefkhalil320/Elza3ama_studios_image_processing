Welcome to Elza3ama Studios! This project provides a user-friendly interface for applying various image preprocessing functions using Gradio. You can upload an image and select from a range of preprocessing options to enhance or manipulate the image according to your requirements.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the application by executing the main script:

```
python main.py
```


Once the application is running, open a web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:7860). You will see the interface where you can upload an image and select preprocessing functions from the dropdown menu and adjust the sliders for certain functions if needed. After selecting the desired options, click on the "Process" button to apply the selected preprocessing functions to the uploaded image. The processed image will be displayed below the input controls.
